# Music Pages: Album Artwork

1. Standardize all album artwork to 600x600 px.
  - If you can't find an image large enough, get one as close to 600x600 as possible. (But on screen widths 575px and below, the album artwork will be full-width, so it may become pixelated.)
2. Naming Conventions:
  - Directory names are *artist* names only.
  - File names are *album* names only.
  - *Artist* and *album* names must follow the kebab-case naming conventions.
3. Filetype must be `.jpg` (*not* `.jpeg`).

If all of these conventions are followed, the existing logic will automatically detect the artwork and add it to the UI.
