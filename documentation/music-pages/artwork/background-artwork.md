# Music Pages: Background Artwork

1. Standardize all background artwork to 1920x1080 px.
2. Naming Conventions:
    - Assuming the background image is the cover art for one of the titles, put the image file in the __assets/img/titles/`title-name`__ directory.
    - File name must be `wide-no-text`.
3. Filetype must be `.jpg` (*not* `.jpeg`).

If all of these conventions are followed, the existing logic will automatically detect the artwork and add it to the UI.
