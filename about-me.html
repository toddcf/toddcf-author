          <p class="body_p font_size_body">I figure if you came to my About page, you're looking for something a little deeper than the one-paragraph bio you saw in one of my books. Plus, I never really stop and think about how all of this came to be, at least not in a chronological, comprehensive way, so it would be kind of nice for me to run through it.</p>

          <h2 class="section-title font_size_3">Instincts of Unknown Origin</h2>
        </header>
        <div class="p-container">
          <p class="body_p font_size_body">When I look back on it, I realize that reading and writing have always held an undeniable pull for me. I began writing little books in first grade, stapling the pages together into a spine. For Christmas in second grade, I asked for (and received) a book on how to write cursive so I could teach myself. I didn't want to wait until third grade to learn. Back then, I was just following my instincts without much question. I now have the perspective to realize that these things were unusual, and say a lot about me as a person.</p>

          <p class="body_p font_size_body">The summer after I completed middle school, my family moved from Altadena, California to Portland, Oregon. I was excited, but there was still a month or two before school started, and I didn't yet have other ways of meeting people. I spent a lot of time alone in my room. Every morning, painters would wake me up at 7:00 a.m. as they set up their ladders against a nearby house. And so would begin another day of stifling boredom.</p>

          <p class="body_p font_size_body">I soon decided to write a YA novel not only to entertain myself, but to have something to show for my time. It was called <cite class="project-title">Snow Aces</cite>, and was about two best friends in middle school who had adventures sledding down the hills of their neighborhood and doing battle with a local bully, whose sister the main character had a crush on. I cranked out some good pages, but ultimately got stuck after several chapters.</p>

        </header>
        <div class="p-container">
          <p class="body_p font_size_body">It wasn't until halfway through high school that I began work on a new novella, <cite class="project-title">Kevin</cite>. I was once again sitting at home, bored, when I randomly decided to create a more interesting world to escape into. I had no idea where the story was going, and I certainly wasn't working off an outline &mdash; I just made everything up as I went along. Whatever I decided would make the current scene more interesting, I threw in.</p>

          <p class="body_p font_size_body">Soon, the floodgates were open, and I found myself racing toward an exciting climax. I couldn't write fast enough to keep up with the ideas that were coming in &mdash; and the fact that I was writing the entire thing by hand because I didn't own a computer wasn't exactly speeding things along. I would take my handwritten notebook (plus the loose pages rubber&ndash;banded to the notebook) to the computer lab at school and transcribe as much as I could after school class each afternoon.</p>

          <p class="body_p font_size_body">I won't even recount the plot of this one, but it was important because it was the first long&ndash;form book I actually finished writing. From that moment on, I had the mentality that I was somebody who <em class="emphasis">finished</em> projects.</p>

          <h2 class="section-title font_size_3">Heat</h2>
        </header>
        <div class="p-container">
          <p class="body_p font_size_body">Then, midway through high school, I saw Michael Mann's <a href="http://amzn.to/2tIXZeo" target="_blank" class="text-link"><cite class="project-title">Heat</cite></a>, and my entire worldview pivoted. It was the first &mdash; and probably still the only &mdash; time I'd seen a character like De Niro's in a movie. Not a wildcard who &ldquo;plays by his own rules,&rdquo; but someone methodical and introverted; a detail&ndash;oriented perfectionist who planned out all his moves in advance before executing them. He felt like a real person to me, and in fact I identified with him a lot (minus the sociopathic qualities).</p>

          <p class="body_p font_size_body">But even beyond this, Mann's storytelling style captivated me. Whereas a novel plays out in the theater of the reader's mind, I was blown away by how much control a filmmaker had over his or her audience's experience. They could use angles, edits, lighting, and music to create very specific moods, and I decided I wanted in on this.</p>

          <p class="body_p font_size_body">My focus shifted almost immediately to screenplays, and I quickly and obsessively wrote a very stylized feature&ndash;length CIA action epic called <cite class="project-title">The Aggression</cite>. I also wrote, directed, and edited a short James Bond movie on VHS for a class project, which was a lot of fun.</p>

          <h2 class="section-title font_size_3">Film School</h2>
        </header>
        <div class="p-container">
          <p class="body_p font_size_body">After high school, I majored in Film Production at Chapman University in Orange, California. (This had the added benefit of getting me out of the Portland rain and back into the California sun &mdash; all part of my plan.)</p>

          <p class="body_p font_size_body">It was here that I wrote a sequel to <cite class="project-title">The Aggression</cite> called <cite class="project-title">Corruption</cite>, which actually incorporated a lot of elements from <cite class="project-title">Kevin</cite> into its B&ndash;story. I also wrote a standalone feature&ndash;length comedy called <cite class="project-title">Defective Miller</cite>, about a 25&ndash;year&ndash;old still living at home with his parents who advertises himself as a private eye despite having no training, experience, or license. <cite class="project-title">Defective Miller</cite> won first place in Chapman's <cite class="project-title">Calliope</cite> publication.</p>

          <p class="body_p font_size_body">Junior year, I wrote two short scripts worth mentioning: <cite class="project-title">Welcome To My Mind</cite> and <cite class="project-title">The Image-Conscious War Zone</cite>. Both were a departure from my previous action&ndash;adventure forays. <cite class="project-title">Welcome To My Mind</cite> was a character&ndash;driven relationship piece about a high school senior trying to win the heart of a damaged girl who considers him too stable to be attractive. The script was a finalist for Chapman's Location Filmmaking program, in which the school funds a handful of student films each year. However, <cite class="project-title">Welcome To My Mind</cite> was not chosen for funding.</p>

          <p class="body_p font_size_body"><cite class="project-title">The Image-Conscious War Zone</cite> was in a similar vein, but much darker. It told the story of a sensitive, reclusive, heartbroken, well&ndash;known author who is attempting to withdraw from the world when he is seduced &mdash; and ultimately betrayed &mdash; by a young female journalist. The project was performed as a play at Chapman University, directed by my good friend, <a href="https://www.toddluoto.com/" target="_blank">Todd Luoto</a>.</p>

          <p class="body_p font_size_body">At the end of my junior year, I was awarded the Cinetech Most Promising Filmmaker grant, which provided funding for my senior thesis film. That summer, I used the money to film <cite class="project-title">Welcome To My Mind</cite>.</p>

          <p class="body_p font_size_body">Senior year, I teamed up with my friend David Malki to produce his Location Filmmaking project, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1556555/?ref_=nm_knf_t2" target="_blank" class="text-link"><cite class="project-title">Accusation</cite></a>, about a man whose stepdaughter accuses him of inappropriate advances, sparking an investigation by her school. The film went on to earn Dave and I the Best Picture Award that year at Chapman.</p>

          <h2 class="section-title font_size_3">Post-College</h2>
        </header>
        <div class="p-container">
          <p class="body_p font_size_body">The end of college was a difficult transition for me. While most of my friends were getting internships or jobs, moving to Los Angeles, and pairing off as roommates, I was down to $300 and no car. The only realistic thing to do was move back into my parents' home in Portland for a couple years. Unable to find film work in Portland, I got a job in sales &mdash; a skill I figured would serve me well in Hollywood, anyway &mdash; and saved up for a car. Then I transferred my job to Los Angeles and rejoined my film school friends, eager to get my career off the ground.</p>

          <p class="body_p font_size_body">I soon reteamed with Dave to cowrite a short script called <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1181606/?ref_=nm_knf_t1" target="_blank" class="text-link"><cite class="project-title">Expendable</cite></a>, a James Bond&ndash;style action&ndash;comedy told from the henchmen's point of view. I produced &mdash; and Dave directed &mdash; the movie, which went on to play in over 30 film festivals worldwide. We then wrote a feature&ndash;length version of the concept called <cite class="project-title">Henchmen Wanted</cite>, which landed us a manager.</p>

      <section class="section">
        <header class="section-header">
          <h2 class="section-title font_size_3">Novels</h2>
        </header>
        <div class="p-container">
          <p class="body_p font_size_body">It was during these years, however, that it became painfully clear that I would never be able to save up the money to direct my own movie at my current salary and with the high cost of living in Los Angeles. I was constantly having to find creative ways to stay afloat financially, and survival was my main focus. But writing was always free, and my focus soon turned back to novels &mdash; my original passion. This freed me up creatively to write without a budget in mind. Locations, props, cast, crew, and food were no longer limiters.</p>

          <p class="body_p font_size_body">Writing a novel also meant that my project could actually see the light of day. Whereas if I finished writing a screenplay, the next step was to produce it if I wanted anybody to experience my story, if I finished writing a novel, the words <em class="emphasis">were</em> the finished product.</p>

          <p class="body_p font_size_body">Although my original attraction to film had been the amount of control it would afford me over the audience's emotions, I had also discovered firsthand that the finished product never quite comes out the way you envisioned it. Shots are a little different, performances, the look of the actors, the colors, locations, etc. Everything gets compromised at least a little until you wind up with something different than what you thought was on the page.</p>

          <p class="body_p font_size_body">So there was something refreshing about retreating into the world of novel&ndash;writing. This also provided me with the opportunity to tell a story that was far too internal to make as a film. This novel was <a href="http://amzn.to/2ipuYA7" target="_blank" class="text-link"><cite class="project-title">Catch Up To Myself</cite></a>, which went on to become my first published book.</p>

          <p class="body_p font_size_body">I wrote the entire manuscript by hand, although for very different reasons than I had in the past. This time I <em class="emphasis">did</em> own a computer, but I wanted to get two passes out of my first draft: one to handwrite, and another while transcribing. As I transcribed, I made improvements and caught mistakes and repetitions, resulting in a much more polished first draft than normal. This is a technique I've used on every novel and short story I've written since.</p>

          <p class="body_p font_size_body">This first draft of <a href="http://amzn.to/2ipuYA7" target="_blank" class="text-link"><cite class="project-title">Catch Up To Myself</cite></a> took me two years to write, about four times longer than I was used to with screenplays. (A novel has much more text on each page than a screenplay&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;and more pages.) This required me to start outlining in more detail than I had in the past, as I couldn't possibly hold every nuance and callback in my head for that long. The outline for <a href="http://amzn.to/2ipuYA7" target="_blank" class="text-link"><cite class="project-title">Catch Up To Myself</cite></a> was about 26 pages long, which was massive for me at the time. Now, it is common for me to work with 80+ page outlines, as I break down each scene into precise detail.</p>
